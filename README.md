### [Recognition and Classification of drugs names.](https://github.com/DanileRond/Advanced-Human-Language-Technologies/blob/main/NERC_Castells_Navarrete.pdf)
Abstract—In this work we present two different approaches
to do drug recognition and drug classification at DDI corpus.
First of all, we present a rule based model, where we model
the classification via rules we define while exploring the data.
Afterwards, we develop machine learning algorithm based on
sequence prediction to do the task.
Index Terms—rule based model, machine learning, drug recognition, drug classification
